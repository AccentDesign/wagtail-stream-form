Wagtail Streamforms
===================

Allows you to add add forms that are built in the cms admin area to any streamfield. 
You can also create your own types of forms and templates which will then appear as a template choice when
you build your form. 

This allows you to decide how the form is submitted and to where.

You can also add site wide regex validators fo use in regex fields.
